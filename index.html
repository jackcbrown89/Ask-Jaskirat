                        I won't lie to you. A lot of people ask me this question daily. I just honestly think it's a combination of how lit my social skills are, the way I dress, and my fake Indian accent.

                One word: time management. It's a skill I've seemed to master. I once won a hackathon without falling behind on my daily bhangra intake, not to mention I also glanced at a few quantum notes for my upcoming midterm that I totally rocked.
                <p></p>
                My 5 pieces of advice for your situation:
                <p></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Save time by not showering. Just cover up your stank with coconut oil
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep your dreams above all else. Sometimes I just zone out during exams or really important conversations in order to think about Bhangra
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When in doubt, remember your bases: 1st base, making out, 2nd base cuddling, 3rd base anal, and we all know what a homerun is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Treat all your ladies like they don't deserve you, even though they probably do. You're not Jaskirat Vig, for fuck's sake.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Work out to keep the guns big. Ladies like big bicepts - trust me ;)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
            </div>
        </row>
        <row>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="panel panel-default center-block">
                    <div class="panel-heading"><i>"How did you become such a tremendous Bhangra sensai?"</i></div>

                        It probably stems from my incredible athletic ability. Sports have always come naturally to me as a child. They didn't even let me join the basketball and football team because I was simply too good; it would be unfair to the other kids.
                        <p></p>
                        As for Bhangra, I started dancing when I was young and ever since then I've been using it to pick up chicks whose fathers only let them date Punjabi boys.
